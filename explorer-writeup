1) setup tomcat - minor issue with java home (fails to launch w no error msg)

2) got source - no docs

3) build source: ant client.build -- errors! cant find class EventBus

- go jar hunting - only comes with 2 guava jar files
- modify env vars to point to jars
- gwt 2.4 has a bunch of them
gwt-servlet gwt-dev
- have to modify ant file(several targets) to include these jars - strange? the original developers had these
things in their default classpath - dont bother mentioning this!


oauth jar
jsr305 jar - annotations
junit

was using Join class from old collections instead of Joiner from new guava
where most of the code uses guava - but its mixed code - ya had to have both
 odd because theres a warning never to use both guava and collections
 modified code to use new Joiner class - compiles

the order of jars seemed to matter - bad sign - overlapping classes

(wed)

ant (build) explorer.gwtbuild
to compile java into javascript
Unable to find 'com/google/common/collect/Collect.gwt.xml
wants gwt.xml - i put them in - but why werent they there?

(tried making war myself - didnt understand the javascript compile)

study gwt - learn about javascript compile - make a sample gwt app with webAppCreator
did ant devmode - cool - chrome plugin
(api explorer doesnt have devmode which is crucial - eventually add one myself)

start wondering if versions of jars match - 

getting js compile to work
had to add to ant file (why not there? jar comes with download!)
guava-r07-gwt.jar which had the Collect.gwt.xml

realize my gwt-user jar is wrong one - woops

gwt-user.jar has AutoBean gwt xml

resources/images not found - theyre their - have to move them - again wierd

Nullable issue appeared and disappeared - wierd - jsr jar was used and taken out
Nullable couldnt be resolved to a type

finally compiled to js - end of wednesday
deploy war file to tomcat
and things are not in right place
have to move html file
and change line in html that points to javascript

it comes up but no services loading/displaying

javascript errors 
doing injection - retrieving a javascript from google website and injecting it into running script
to use to contact services 
that injected script didnt jibe with my compiled script
the explorer code had in it embedded javascript that was calling the injected code
and that call was failing - so the open source and the injection code were out of synch

fixed some stuff live - wresteld with it
the errors just got worse and more confusing from funny compiled javascript


killer:
the javascript i was seeing locally and javascript on actual site were different!
broken source and working source were out of synch!! divergence


red flags
forums are dead 
authors not replying to email
not much out there on google

took a while to figure out as was learning GWT which is a confusing framework


also got dupe working with json - forked the code

and upgraded mauth to ethans mauth client

refactored mauth per ethans request following rodrigos agi fog - 
thread safe
only have to do an include for doing mauth headers


retrospective
know when to hold em know when to fold em
just because its google dont mean it aint crap
keep learning new stuff
